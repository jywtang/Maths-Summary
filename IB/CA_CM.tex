\section{Analytic function}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Complex differentiability: same limit definition but quantify $\delta x$ over all of $\C$
    \item Analytic (regular/holomorphic) function: $f$ is analytic at $z$ if $\exists$ open neighbourhood of $z$ where $f'$ exists \\ (not just differentiable at a point)
    \item Entire function: analytic throughout $\C$ \\(analytic implies infinitely diffable; bounded entire implies constant)
    \item Complex diffable at $z \implies$ Cauchy-Riemann eqns \\ (converse holds if $u,v$ diffable at $z$)
    \item $f = u+iv$ analytic $\implies u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$ harmonic
    \item Harmonic conjugates: $u,v$ are harmonic conjugates if they satisfy C-R equations
    \item Multivalued functions have branch point, introduce branch cut to make single valued and continuous

    \item Mobius maps

    \item Conformal map: $f: U \to V$, both $U,V$ open subsets of $\C$\\
          $f$ is conformal if analytic with non-zero derivative\\
          $\iff$ angles preserved (i.e. amplitwist)
\end{itemize}
