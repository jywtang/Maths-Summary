\section{Uniform Convergence and Uniform Continuity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous (so if cts function converges to discts function, it does not converge uniformly)
    \item Uniform limit of bounded functions is bounded
    \item Uniform limit of integrable functions is integrable (integral of limit = limit of integral)
    \item If $\sum f'_n$ converges uniformly on $[a,b]$ and $\sum f_n$ converges at one point in $[a,b]$, then $\sum f_n$ converges uniformly, and has derivative $\sum f'_n$.
    \item Uniformly Cauchy sequences; general principle of uniform convergence
    \item Weierstrass M-test: series of bounded functions with infinite sum of bounds convergent: series uniformly convergent
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Power series}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Power series converges pointwise inside radius of convergence, but not uniformly
    \item Converges locally uniformly: for any point there is an open set in which uniformly convergent
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Uniform continuity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Any continuous function on a closed bounded interval $[a,b]$ is uniformly continuous (compactness?)
    \item Continuous implies integrable
\end{itemize}
\section{Metric Spaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Axioms; subspaces, product
    \item Convergence, continuity
    \item ($x_n \to a \implies f(x_n) \to a$ for all sequence equivalent to continuity in metric space)
    \item Composite of cts is cts
    \item Isometric (isometry is a surjective isometric map), Lipschitz, uniformly continuous
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Topology of metric spaces}
\item Open/closed ball, open/closed set, neighbourhood
\item In metric space, closed set $\iff$ contains all limits $\iff$ complement open
\item Characterise convergence using metric, neighbourhood or open sets
\item Continuity: at a point, the whole space
\item Metric topology
\item Homeomorphism (cts bijection with cts inverse), equivalent metric spaces; uniformly/Lipschitz equivalent

\section{Completeness, Contraction Mapping Theorem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete space: every Cauchy sequence converges
    \item Cts bounded scalar sequence (to $\mathbb{R}$) is Complete
    \item
\end{itemize}

\section*{Connectedness}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Disjoint non-empty open sets that cover the whole space
    \item $X$ connected iff image of cts function from $X$ to reals/integers
    \item Connected sets in $\R$
    \item Open sets disconnect a subspace
    \item Connected subspace viewed as a subset: closure is connected
    \item Cts image of connected spe is connected (so connectedness is top prop)
    \item Union of connected subsets (with pairwise non-empty intersections) is connected
    \item Product of connected spaces
\end{itemize}
