# Maths-Summary
This is a set of summary notes I produced for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos (Part IA to Part II 2019-2022). The notes are purely 
intended for personal use, but might be helpful for anyone revising these topics having already learned them.

The LaTeX files have to be compiled with the header.tex document (placed two directories above the document to be compiled);
this choice is purely for convenience as I typed the notes on my computer. Please let me know if you have a more ideal modification.
Part of the header document is taken from Dexter Chua (https://dec41.user.srcf.net/notes/).

Some of the notes contain references to lecture numbers for convenience as I contrast the content against my handwritten notes,
and can be ignored. Moreover, I am certain that there are mistakes in the notes, I am happy to receive corrections if you spot any.
